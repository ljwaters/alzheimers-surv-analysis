# Alzheimer's Disease Survival Analysis

Included is the slides and Quarto markdown for a survival analysis group project. In this project, we analyzed a large synthetic health dataset to identify which factors are most closely associated with Alzheimerâ€™s diagnosis over time. Using R, we applied survival analysis methods (including Kaplan-Meier, Weibull, and Cox proportional hazards models) to explore and predict diagnosis risk based on cognitive, functional, and behavioral assessments. Along the way, we compared models, checked assumptions, and visualized survival trends by gender. This work highlights skills in statistical modeling, feature selection, and translating health data into actionable insights.

Note: The code in the QMD is only what I worked on myself. There are visuals and models in the slides that I did not personally write and did not have access to while making this repository.
